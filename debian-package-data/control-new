Description: This package, atomes, provides an atomic-scale 3D modeling toolbox
 Atomes is a tool box to analyze (physico-chemical properties calculations),
 visualize (atoms, bonds, colormaps, measurements, coordination polyedra ...)
 create (crystal builder, molecular library, surface creation
 and passivation ...) 3D atomistic models.
 Atomes offers a workspace capable of handling many projects
 opened simultaneously.
 The different projects in the workspace can exchange data:
 analysis results, atomic coordinates...
 Atomes also provides an advanced input preparation system
 for further calculations using well known molecular dynamics codes:
 Classical MD: DLPOLY and LAMMPS
 - ab-initio MD: CPMD and CP2K
 - QM-MM MD: CPMD and CP2K
 To prepare the input files for these calculations is likely
 to be the key, and most complicated step towards MD simulations.
 Atomes offers a user-friendly assistant to help and guide
 the scientist step by step to achieve this crucial step.
